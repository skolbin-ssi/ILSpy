### Input code
Please provide the input that failed to decompile.
If providing IL code as input, please provide enough context to allow us to re-assemble the IL.
If uploading a complete assembly, please mention which method failed to decompile.

### Erroneous output
```c#
If relevant, the incorrectly decompiled output, or an exception with stack trace.
```
If the output fails to re-compile, provide the compiler error message.
If the output has the wrong behavior, explain how it differs from the expected behavior.
